This is mostly an attempt to learn more about email, SMTP servers, and encryption, but
I also thought it would beat to attempt to create an easily deployable, self-hosted
encrypted email service with a simple Web UI (written with Flask) that could (hopefully)
be used by anyone for quick, safe, private, and disposable emails.
