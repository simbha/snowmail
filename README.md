This is mostly an attempt to learn more about email, SMTP servers, and encryption, but
I also thought it would be neat to attempt to create an easily deployable, self-hosted
encrypted email service with a simple Web UI (written with Flask) that could (hopefully)
be used by anyone for quick, safe, private, and disposable emails.  

todo
====

- Finish writing the smtp server methods.
- Add sqlite to the project.
- Finish the views and controllers for the Web UI.
- Figure out the best way to run the smtp server.
